A library app which allows users to search for a book or article by the title or the author. Each selected result provides the book's cover image and a short summary. Users can log in using their regular email address or Gmail account. The authentication is provided by Firebase. The logged-in user can add books to two separate lists which are persisted in Firestore.

The application is powered by [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books).
