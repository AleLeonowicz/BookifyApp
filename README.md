A library app with a books database, which can be searched by the title or the author. Each selected result provides the book's cover image and a short summary. The app allows users to log in using their regular email address or Gmail account. The authentication is provided by the Firebase service. The logged-in user can add books to two separate lists: 'to read' and 'favorites'.

The application is powered by [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books).
